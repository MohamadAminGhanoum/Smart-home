This project is made by me, i have found and soldered the components myself. 
I have not bought anything, but the copper-clad plates for this. Therefore my focus in this was to reuse some electronic components from a computer motherboard that i had lying around(An old sony motherboard). I also extracted the motor from a robot vacuum that was not used at all.

"Note, the main code is not fully written by me, and it is not the main focus of this project. It is only here for reference or experimenting."

I have through this project experimented and tried different things in the Kicad app
